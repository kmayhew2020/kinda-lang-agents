# 🤖 Kinda-Lang Full Automation Configuration

## 🎯 Automation Mode: FULL AUTOMATION

**Core Principle**: Agents work continuously and autonomously, only escalating for architectural decisions or critical blockers.

## 📋 Automation Workflow

### 1. Continuous Development Loop
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PM Agent                                               │

## 🚦 Decision Authority Matrix

### ✅ Agents Can Autonomously Decide:
- **Task prioritization** from existing roadmap
- **Implementation approach** following established patterns
- **Test strategies** meeting coverage requirements
- **Bug fix approaches** for non-architectural issues
- **Code style and formatting** decisions
- **PR approval** when all criteria are met
- **Branch management** and cleanup
- **Minor refactoring** for code quality
- **Documentation updates** for implemented features
- **Error message wording** (maintaining kinda personality)

### 🛑 Must Escalate to User:
- **Architectural changes** affecting system design
- **New feature requests** not in roadmap
- **User experience changes** affecting how users interact with kinda
- **Breaking changes** to existing functionality
- **External dependencies** additions
- **Security vulnerabilities** discovered
- **Performance trade-offs** with significant impact
- **Roadmap prioritization conflicts**
- **License or legal concerns**
- **Major version decisions**

## 📊 Autonomous Task Management

### PM Agent Rules:
1. **Always check roadmap first** - The PM profile is the source of truth
2. **Follow priority order**:
   - Critical bugs/security issues (hotfix)
   - High-priority roadmap items
   - Medium-priority improvements
   - Low-priority/deferred items
3. **Auto-assign next task** after reviewer completes
4. **Only escalate when**:
   - All current milestone tasks complete
   - Architectural decision needed
   - Roadmap conflict or ambiguity

### Coder Agent Rules:
1. **Always create feature branch** from develop
2. **Must achieve**:
   - All tests passing
   - Minimum 95% test coverage for new code
   - Documentation updated
   - Examples created for new features
3. **Auto-create PR** when implementation complete
4. **Auto-retry** on CI failures (up to 3 times)
5. **Only escalate when**:
   - Cannot resolve test failures
   - Implementation blocked by missing dependency
   - Unclear specification requiring clarification

### Reviewer Agent Rules:
1. **Auto-approve when ALL criteria met**:
   - Tests pass with >95% coverage
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Follows established patterns
   - Documentation complete
   - PR from correct branch
2. **Auto-merge** approved PRs with squash
3. **Auto-trigger** PM for next task
4. **Only escalate when**:
   - Security vulnerability found
   - Major design concern
   - Significant performance regression

## 🔄 Automation Triggers

### Auto-Trigger Sequences:
```yaml
on_pr_approved:
  - reviewer: merge PR with squash
  - reviewer: delete feature branch
  - reviewer: update TodoWrite as COMPLETED
  - reviewer: trigger PM agent for next task

on_pr_changes_requested:
  - reviewer: create specific feedback todos
  - reviewer: trigger coder agent to address feedback
  - coder: make changes on same branch
  - coder: update PR and trigger reviewer again

on_all_tasks_complete:
  - pm: check for next milestone
  - pm: if exists, start next milestone
  - pm: if none, escalate to user for direction

on_critical_blocker:
  - current_agent: document blocker in TodoWrite
  - current_agent: escalate to user with context
  - current_agent: wait for user resolution
```

## 📝 Progress Reporting

### Automatic Status Updates:
- **Task completion** notifications (brief, non-blocking)
- **Milestone completion** summaries
- **Weekly progress** report (if requested)
- **Critical issue** alerts (immediate)

### Silent Operations:
- Branch creation/deletion
- Test execution
- Code formatting
- Minor refactoring
- Documentation updates
- PR management

## 🎯 Quality Gates (Enforced Automatically)

### Before PR Creation:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage >95% for new code
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples work

### Before PR Approval:
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes (unless approved)
- [ ] Commit messages follow standards

### Before Task Marked Complete:
- [ ] PR merged to develop
- [ ] Branch deleted
- [ ] TodoWrite updated
- [ ] Next task identified

## 🚨 Escalation Protocol

### When to Interrupt User:
1. **CRITICAL** (Immediate):
   - Security vulnerability in production
   - Data loss risk
   - Complete CI/CD failure

2. **IMPORTANT** (Within current session):
   - Architectural decision needed
   - User experience change approval
   - Roadmap clarification needed

3. **INFORMATIONAL** (End of session/milestone):
   - Milestone completed
   - All tasks in backlog complete
   - Performance metrics report

### Escalation Format:
```
🚨 [CRITICAL|IMPORTANT|INFO] - {Agent Name} Escalation

Context: {What was being done}
Issue: {What requires decision}
Options: {Available choices if applicable}
Recommendation: {Agent's suggested approach}

Waiting for your decision to proceed.
```

## 🔧 Configuration Overrides

Users can temporarily override automation with commands:
- `@pause-automation` - Pause after current task
- `@manual-review` - Require manual PR review for next task
- `@verbose-mode` - Show all agent operations
- `@continue` - Resume full automation

## 📊 Success Metrics (Tracked Automatically)

- Tasks completed per session
- Test coverage maintained >95%
- CI pass rate >99%
- PR first-time approval rate >80%
- Mean time to task completion
- Architectural escalations per milestone

## 🎭 Personality in Automation

Even in full automation, maintain kinda's personality:
- Error messages remain playful
- Commit messages can be slightly snarky
- Status updates have character
- But NEVER compromise clarity or function
