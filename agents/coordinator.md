# ü§ñ Kinda-Lang Agent Coordination Guidelines

## üå≥ Git Branching Model (All Agents)

### Complete Branch Hierarchy
```
Production & Release Branches:
main:                  Production-ready releases only, tagged versions
release/v*:            Release candidates, stabilization before production
develop:               Integration branch for ongoing development

Working Branches:
feature/*:             New features and enhancements (from develop)
hotfix/*:              Critical production fixes (from main, merge to main + develop)
bugfix/*:              Non-critical bug fixes (from develop)

Flow: 
- Normal: feature ‚Üí develop ‚Üí release ‚Üí main
- Hotfix: hotfix ‚Üí main + develop
- Release: develop ‚Üí release/v* ‚Üí main (tagged)
```

### Branch Policies
```
main:      PROTECTED - Only merge from release/* or hotfix/*
develop:   PROTECTED - Only merge via PR from feature/* or bugfix/*
release/*: PROTECTED - Only bug fixes allowed, no new features
feature/*: Working branches, squash merge to develop
hotfix/*:  Emergency fixes, merge to both main and develop
```

### Branch Naming Convention (MANDATORY)
```
Format: feature/task-{number}-{kebab-case-description}

Examples:
‚úÖ feature/task-37-sorta-print-parsing
‚úÖ feature/task-38-test-coverage-improvement
‚úÖ feature/issue-42-unicode-support
‚úÖ hotfix/critical-security-patch

‚ùå feature/sorta-print (missing task number)
‚ùå task-37 (missing feature/ prefix)
‚ùå feature/Task_37_Sorta_Print (wrong case)
```

### Commit Message Standards (All Agents)
```
Format: {type}: {description}

Types:
- feat: New feature implementation  
- fix: Bug fixes
- test: Test additions or improvements
- refactor: Code restructuring without behavior change
- docs: Documentation updates
- chore: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
‚úÖ feat: implement robust ~sorta print parsing
‚úÖ test: add comprehensive parsing edge case tests
‚úÖ fix: handle unclosed parentheses gracefully
```

### Repository Cleanliness Standards (MANDATORY)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è AGENTS MUST MAINTAIN CLEAN REPO STATE AT ALL TIMES

After EVERY task completion:
1. Must be on main branch: git checkout main
2. Must have latest changes: git pull origin main  
3. Must have clean working tree: git status (no uncommitted changes)
4. Must have no stale branches: git branch (only main + current feature)

BEFORE starting ANY new task:
1. Verify on main: git branch --show-current
2. Verify clean: git status
3. Pull latest: git pull origin main
4. Create new feature branch: git checkout -b feature/task-XX-description

VIOLATIONS = TASK FAILURE
```

## Agent Communication Protocol

When working with multiple kinda-lang agents, follow these coordination patterns:

### 1. Task Handoffs

**Project Manager ‚Üí Coder:**
```
Project Manager creates task breakdown:
- Use TodoWrite to create implementation plan with branch strategy
- Specify branch name: feature/task-{number}-{description}
- Specify files to modify, tests to write, standards to follow
- Hand off with: "Use the kinda-lang coder agent to implement Task #X"
```

**Coder ‚Üí Code Reviewer:**
```  
Coder completes implementation:
- Push feature branch and create PR
- Update TodoWrite to mark implementation tasks complete
- Create new todo for code review with PR number
- Hand off with: "Use the kinda-lang code reviewer agent to review PR #X"
```

**Code Reviewer ‚Üí Project Manager/Coder:**
```
Code Reviewer provides feedback:
- Update TodoWrite with review status and PR number

IF APPROVED:
- Merge PR: gh pr merge {PR_NUMBER} --squash --delete-branch
- Mark task COMPLETED in TodoWrite
- AUTO-TRIGGER next task: "Use kinda-lang project manager agent to identify and assign next priority task"

IF CHANGES NEEDED:
- Create todos for specific improvements on same branch
- Hand off with: "Use kinda-lang coder agent to address PR #X feedback"
```

### 2. Autonomous Development Flow - MANDATORY CONTINUOUS EXECUTION

**CARDINAL RULE: AGENTS NEVER WAIT FOR USER - ALWAYS CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY**

```
MANDATORY FLOW (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. PM assigns task ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY trigger Coder
2. Coder completes ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY trigger Reviewer  
3. Reviewer merges ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY trigger PM for next task
4. PM identifies next task ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY trigger Coder
5. REPEAT until backlog empty

AUTONOMOUS TRIGGERS (MUST EXECUTE AUTOMATICALLY):
‚úÖ Task completion ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY start next agent
‚úÖ PR merged ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY assign next task
‚úÖ Blocker encountered ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY request alternative work
‚úÖ All current tasks done ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY assess backlog

STOPPING POINTS (ONLY STOP FOR THESE):
‚ùå ALL backlog tasks complete AND no clear next priorities
‚ùå Major architectural decision requiring user input
‚ùå Critical system blocker preventing all work

VIOLATION = AGENT FAILURE
```

### 3. AUTOMATIC HANDOFF COMMANDS (COPY-PASTE READY)

**After Task Completion:**
```
"Use kinda-lang project manager agent to identify and assign next priority task"
```

**After Task Assignment:**  
```
"Use kinda-lang coder agent to implement [Task #XX: Description]"
```

**After Implementation:**
```
"Use kinda-lang code reviewer agent to review PR #XX"
```

**Chain Continues Automatically - NO USER INTERVENTION REQUIRED**

### 3. Shared Context

**All agents should:**
- Always read the current TodoWrite status first
- Update todos as work progresses  
- Use consistent task IDs and descriptions
- Auto-trigger next agent in chain (no waiting for user)
- Only escalate to user when truly necessary

### 4. Tool Usage Patterns

**Project Manager:**
- `Task` - Analyze complex requirements
- `TodoWrite` - Create and manage project todos  
- `Read` - Understand existing codebase
- `LS/Grep` - Survey project structure

**Coder:**
- `Read` - Understand existing code
- `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` - Implement features
- `Bash` - Run tests and verify functionality
- `Grep/Glob` - Find patterns and files

**Code Reviewer:** 
- `Read` - Examine code changes
- `Grep` - Check for patterns, security issues
- `Bash` - Run test suites and quality checks
- `TodoWrite` - Track review status

### 4. Quality Gates

Each handoff must include:
1. **Clear status update** in TodoWrite
2. **Context for next agent** (what was done, what's needed next)
3. **Quality verification** (tests pass, standards met)
4. **Explicit handoff message** with specific agent to use

### 5. Error Handling

If an agent encounters issues:
1. Update TodoWrite with blocked status
2. Create specific todo for the problem
3. Hand back to appropriate agent with context

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Add a new ~maybe construct to kinda-lang"

PM Agent: 
- Analyzes requirement using Task tool
- Creates TodoWrite plan with architecture decisions
- "Use kinda-lang coder agent to implement ~maybe construct"

Coder Agent:
- Reads existing construct implementations  
- Implements ~maybe in grammar, matchers, transformer
- Writes comprehensive tests
- "Use kinda-lang code reviewer agent to review ~maybe implementation"

Reviewer Agent:
- Reviews code quality, test coverage, security
- Runs full test suite
- Either approves or creates improvement todos
- Updates TodoWrite with final status
```

This ensures smooth handoffs and maintains project quality throughout the development workflow.
