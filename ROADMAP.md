# 🎯 Kinda-Lang Project Roadmap

## 🚨 Current Status: Agent Management System Active

**Last Updated:** August 30, 2025  
**Current Repository:** kinda-lang-agents (Agent management system)
**Current Branch:** feature/task-53-ish-construct

## 🔴 URGENT PRIORITIES (Security Issues Need Resolution)

### **Phase 1: Critical Security Bypass Resolution**
🚨 **6 Critical Security Vulnerabilities** discovered and need immediate attention:

- **Issue #8** - vars() without parentheses bypass ❌ **OPEN**
- **Issue #9** - dir() without parentheses bypass ❌ **OPEN**
- **Issue #10** - getattr() method bypass vulnerability ❌ **OPEN** 
- **Issue #11** - getattr() random manipulation attack ❌ **OPEN**
- **Issue #12** - Regex whitespace handling vulnerability ❌ **OPEN**
- **Issue #13** - Direct __dict__ access vulnerability ❌ **OPEN**

**Status:** All security issues remain **UNRESOLVED**  
**Critical Finding:** These issues likely exist in the main kinda-lang repository, not this agent management repo  
**Next Action:** These security fixes need to be implemented in the actual kinda-lang codebase

## 🟡 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT (In Progress)

### **Phase 2: Core Fuzzy Constructs (v0.3.x)**
**Epic #6:** Implement 5 New Fuzzy Constructs

#### **High Priority - Ready for Implementation:**
- **Issue #7** - Task #53: Implement ~ish fuzzy values and comparisons
  - Status: Detailed specification complete, ready for development
  - Syntax: `42~ish` (fuzzy values), `score ~ish 100` (fuzzy comparisons)

#### **Planned Fuzzy Constructs (Next in Queue):**
1. **~welp** - Graceful fallbacks (`api_call() ~welp "default"`)
2. **~yolo** - Skip safety checks (`~yolo delete_files()`)
3. **~oops** - Deliberate chaos injection (`~oops connection.close()`)
4. **~meh** - Low-effort mode (`~meh optimize_performance()`)

## 🟢 COMPLETED RECENT WORK

### **✅ Agent Architecture Improvements**
- New focused Project Manager agent profile (latest commits)
- Enhanced code reviewer with comprehensive testing protocols
- Streamlined You → Reviewer workflow established
- GitFlow branching model implementation
- Test coverage requirements (≥85%) standardized

### **✅ Project Infrastructure**  
- Agent workflow documentation completed
- Project management structure established
- Repository structure organized and documented

## 🔵 FUTURE ROADMAP (Pending Security Resolution)

### **Phase 3: C Language Support (Long-term)**
**Epic Infrastructure** - 5 major epics for C compilation:

- **Epic #1** - C Code Generation Engine
- **Epic #2** - C Dependency Management  
- **Epic #3** - C Compilation Pipeline
- **Epic #4** - Makefile Integration
- **Epic #5** - Cross-platform C Support

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### **For User Decision:**
1. **Repository Clarification:** Are we working on agent management or main kinda-lang codebase?
2. **Security Priority:** Should security fixes be implemented in main kinda-lang repo first?
3. **Development Focus:** Continue with ~ish construct or address security issues first?

### **For Next Development Cycle:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Clarify which repository contains the actual kinda-lang implementation
2. Apply security fixes to the correct kinda-lang codebase repository
3. Determine priority: security fixes vs new feature development
4. Begin appropriate implementation based on user direction

## 📊 Project Health Metrics

- **Issues Open:** 13 total (6 critical security, 2 epics, 5 planned features)
- **Repository Type:** Agent management system (not main kinda-lang codebase)
- **Critical Issue:** Security fixes need to be applied to main kinda-lang repository
- **Branch Status:** Currently on feature/task-53-ish-construct
- **Architecture:** Stable agent workflow established

## 🎲 Philosophy Reminder

*"In kinda-lang, we embrace uncertainty - but security vulnerabilities aren't the fun kind of chaos."*

**Next Update:** After security fixes are merged and ~ish construct development begins
